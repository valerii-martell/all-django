        You can only be convinced of all the advantages of Django and Python in practice.
        To use such technologies, you need to make sure that your web resource
        meets certain requirements. For example, to install "django" it is necessary that the hosting has a UNIX-like
        system.
        For Django to function properly, you need to provide access to one of the web servers: Ngix, Apache, or
        Lighttpd.
        Do not forget that hosting for "django" must be able to run scripts.
        The Cron task scheduler is usually used for this purpose.
        If you don't have time to look for a suitable hosting provider in your city,
        but at the same time you want to get the whole range of services, you can enter the appropriate query in the
        search engine.
